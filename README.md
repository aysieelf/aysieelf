# 👩🏻‍💻 Hi there! I'm Aysel!

## About Me
Fresh graduate of Telerik Academy's Alpha Python Track, where my team project [Kitten Strike API](https://github.com/Alpha63-Match-Score/Match_Score) won 🏆 first place.

I craft 2D games that blend cozy aesthetics with philosophical depth and subtle existential themes. My games aim to create comfortable spaces where players can explore deeper questions about reality and consciousness through witty dialogue and delightfully absurd situations. 

🚀 Open to junior developer positions where I can contribute my unique blend of creativity and technical skills while continuing to grow in the field.

## 🐾 Latest news:
Just finished my second game - a cute little [Snake](https://github.com/aysieelf/Snake) built with Python & PyGame. 🐍

What I learned while making this: 
- How particles work in PyGame 
- Grid-based movement
- Game states 

Super proud of how it turned out, especially the snake's tiny adorable eyes 👀 

## 🐾 What I'm Currently Working On
- Solving puzzles on [HackerRank](https://github.com/aysieelf/HackerRank-Solutions) and [LeetCode](https://github.com/aysieelf/LeetCode-Solutions)
